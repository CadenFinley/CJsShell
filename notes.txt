Here’s a high-level mapping of where “CJ’s Shell” stands today against your feature checklist. I’ve split each item into three buckets: “✔ fully implemented”,
    “⚠ partially done / needs work” and “✘ not present at all”.

    ✔  Fully implemented
    • Overall architecture
      – C++/CMake toolchain, cross-platform build.
      – Interactive REPL (main_process_loop).
    • Invocation & startup
      – Login vs non-login shells (argv[0]=='-…' or -l/--login).
      – Interactive vs non-interactive (-c flag, isatty).
      – Sourcing /.profile and ~/.cjprofile on login, ~/.cjshrc on interactive.
    • Environment & variables
      – Shell-only vs exported vars, get/set/unset, export builtin.
      – Propagating exported vars (execvp uses setenv).
      – Simple scalar vars and special vars (HOME, PATH, PWD, etc.).
    • Parsing & expansions
      – Lexing/tokenizing words, |, &, ;, &&, ||, <, >, >>.
      – Quoting (single/double), backslashes.
      – Parameter expansion $var and ${var}.
      – Tilde () expansion.
      – Globbing (*, ?, […]).
    • Execution engine
      – Built-in table (cd, alias, export, unset, etc.) vs external (PATH search).
      – fork+exec model for sync/async and pipelines.
      – File redirections (<, >, >>).
      – Pipelines (|) with job-control integration.
    • Job control & signals
      – setpgid/tcsetpgrp for fg/bg.
      – SIGINT, SIGCHLD, SIGTSTP handling in shell and children.
    • Interactive features
      – Line-editing/history via isocline (readline‐style, history file).
      – Dynamic, theme-driven PS1 prompt (with git status, time, colors).
    • Aliases & basic configuration
      – alias/unalias builtins, persisted to ~/.cjshrc.
      – Plugin & theme framework, AI extension.

    ⚠  Partially implemented / needs work
    • Script mode entrypoint
      – Only “source” builtin and “-c” command supported; no direct “cjsh script.sh” invocation.
    • System startup files
      – ~/.profile & ~/.cjprofile ≠ /etc/profile; no $XDG_CONFIG_HOME support.
    • Advanced expansions
      – No default/fallback (${var:-…}), length (${#var}), substring, etc.
      – No command substitution ($(…)/backticks) or arithmetic ($((…))).
    • Here-docs (<<) and I/O here-strings.
    • Subshells/grouping ((…)), {…} and asynchronous grouping.
    • Full control‐flow grammar in parser (case/esac, until loops).
    • Shell functions & local variables.
    • Associative/positional/array variables.
    • Rich shell options (shopt/set –o: noclobber, xtrace, verbose, ignoreeof, etc.).
    • Job builtins (jobs, fg, bg, kill, disown) are missing.
    • Tab-completion hooks (only default file completion via isocline).
    • Secondary prompts PS2/PS3/PS4.
    • Tracing/debug (set -x, set -v) and set -e.
    • Security hardening (umask, IFS sanitization, mkstemp for temporaries).
    • Extensibility hooks (precmd, chpwd) beyond simple plugin triggers.

    ✘  Not present at all
    • Authentication/PAM integration.
    • Full POSIX test suite (unit/integration/fuzzing).
    • CI for testing, linting or coverage.
    • Man pages, packaging (deb/rpm/Homebrew) or changelog/release process.
    • Privilege dropping (set-uid handling).

    In practice, the shell core (parsing, exec, job control, interactive editing/history and theming) is in place. The next priorities would be broadening POSIX
    compliance (here-docs, subshells, case/loops, command substitution, full parameter expansions) and then shoring up “polish” around startup files, built-in job
    commands, tab-completion hooks, tracing/debug options and packaging/testing infrastructure.



    1) Overall Architecture
  a) Language/Toolchain
    • Choice of implementation language (C, Rust, Go, even Python)
    • Build system, dependency management, portability targets
  b) Process model
    • Single main loop (“read-eval-print”) for interactive mode
    • Script-mode entrypoint that reads and executes a script file
    • Modules/components: lexer, parser, evaluator, executor, job-control, built-ins, I/O manager, environment manager

2) Initialization & Login Handling
  a) Invocation detection
    • Login vs. non-login shell (argv[0] or flags like “–login”)
    • Interactive vs. non-interactive (isatty(stdin), –c command flags)
  b) Authentication/PAM (optional)
    • If you want your shell to handle password entry or PAM integration
  c) Startup files
    • Read /etc/profile, ~/.profile, ~/.<yoursh>rc for login shells
    • Read ~/.<yoursh>rc or $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/<yoursh>/rc for interactive shells
    • Honor environment variables (ENV, BASH_ENV, etc.)

3) Environment & Variables
  a) Environment table
    • Exported vs. shell-only variables
    • Functions to get/set/unset variables
  b) Types of variables
    • Scalars, arrays, associative arrays (if you choose)
    • Special variables (HOME, PATH, PS1, IFS, UID, etc.)
  c) Exporting semantics
    • Propagating to child processes (execve’s envp)
  d) Readonly/Immutable flags

4) Command Scanning & Parsing
  a) Lexer/Tokenizer
    • Recognize words, operators (|, &, ;, &&, ||), redirection tokens (<, >, >>, <<)
    • Handle quoting (single, double, ANSI-C), backslashes
  b) Parser & Grammar
    • Build a parse tree or AST for:
      – Simple commands
      – Pipelines
      – Lists and compound lists (COMMAND1; COMMAND2, COMMAND1 && COMMAND2)
      – Subshells (( … )) and grouping { … }
      – Conditional constructs (if, case, for, while, until)
    • Error recovery and diagnostics (syntax errors, unexpected tokens)

5) Expansions & Substitutions
  a) Parameter expansion ($var, ${var:-default}, ${#var}, etc.)
  b) Command substitution ($(cmd), backtick syntax)
  c) Arithmetic expansion ($(( … )))
  d) Tilde expansion (~, ~user)
  e) Pathname/glob expansion (*, ?, [...])
  f) Word splitting (respecting IFS)
  g) Quote removal

6) Execution Engine
  a) Built-in vs. external resolution
    • Table of built-in commands (cd, exit, export, alias, unalias, set, unset, …)
    • Searching external executables via PATH, hashing command-cache
  b) Fork+exec model
    • fork() children for external commands or pipelines
    • Search builtin table first, then fork for external
  c) Redirections
    • open()/dup2() for <, >, >>, here-documents (<<)
    • Multiple redirections on the same command
  d) Pipelines
    • Creating pipes, forking each stage, setting up stdin/stdout

7) Job Control & Signal Handling
  a) Process groups and sessions
    • setpgid(), tcsetpgrp() to place pipelines in foreground or background
  b) Signals
    • Handle SIGINT, SIGQUIT, SIGTSTP in the shell vs. children
    • Reap children with SIGCHLD handler and waitpid()
  c) Built-ins: jobs, fg, bg, kill, disown

8) Interactive Features
  a) Line editing
    • Integrate readline/libedit or roll your own (raw/cbreak mode, termios)
    • Support Emacs/Vi keybindings, multi-line editing
  b) History
    • In-memory ring buffer, history file (e.g. ~/.<yoursh>_history)
    • Commands: history, HISTSIZE, HISTFILESIZE, reverse-i-search (Ctrl-R)
  c) Tab/completion
    • Command names, filenames, variables, user-defined completions
    • Completion hooks to support custom expansions (e.g. complete -F)
  d) Prompting
    • PS1, PS2, PS3, PS4 with escape sequences (\u, \h, \w, colors)
    • Dynamic prompts (executes a command to embed Git branch, timestamp, etc.)

9) Scripting Constructs & Control Flow
  a) if/then/elif/else/fi
  b) case/in/esac
  c) for/in/do/done, while/until/do/done
  d) functions
    • Definition syntax, scoping rules, recursion
    • Local variables (local keyword)
  e) Test built-in ([ … ], [[ … ]] if you want extended syntax)
  f) Arithmetic built-in (let, expr, or use arithmetic expansion exclusively)

10) Aliases & Shell Options
  a) Aliases table, recursive alias checking, alias expansion only for simple commands
  b) Options (shopt or set –o)
    • Verbose, xtrace, noclobber, ignoreeof, huponexit, lastpipe, etc.

11) Debugging & Tracing
  a) set –x tracing of commands
  b) verbose mode (set –v)
  c) Error handling (exit on error with set –e)
  d) Logging facilities

12) Security & Robustness
  a) Safe defaults for PATH, IFS, umask
  b) Avoid word-splitting pitfalls, quote your expansions in code
  c) Privilege dropping if started setuid (if you ever do that)
  d) Input sanitation for here-docs, eval, read –e
  e) Race conditions in temporary files (use mkstemp, secure directory creation)

13) Extensibility & Configuration

  b) Integration tests against POSIX shell test suites (ShellCheck, shunit2, POSIX tests)
  c) Fuzzing (grammar fuzzers, random scripts)
  d) Continuous integration, cross-platform coverage

15) Documentation & Packaging
  a) man pages (man sh, man bash-builtin)
  b) Online user guide, examples, FAQ
  c) Packaging for your target OS (tarball, deb/rpm, Homebrew, Nix)
  d) Versioning, changelog, release process

–––
Start by mapping out your core pieces—lexer, parser, executor, job-control loop, environment management—then layer on the interactive niceties (readline, history, completion) and the scripting constructs (loops, conditionals, functions). From there you can refine aliases, shell options, debugging/tracing, and finally polish with security hardening, plugins, tests, docs, and package builds. Good luck building your shell!
