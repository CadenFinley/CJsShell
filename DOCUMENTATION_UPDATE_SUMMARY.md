### 4. Updated Navigation Structure

Updated mkdocs.yml to include new documentation:
```yaml
nav:
  - Home: index.md
  - Getting Started:
    - Quick Start: getting-started/quick-start.md
    - Want to help?: getting-started/development.md
  - Scripting:
    - Scripting Guide: scripting/guide.md
  - Reference:
    - Features Overview: reference/features.md
    - Built-in Commands: reference/commands.md
  - Themes:
    - The Details: themes/thedetails.md
```

## Documentation Accuracy

All documentation now accurately reflects:
- Only features that are actually implemented
- Correct command names and syntax
- Current build system and toolchain
- Actual test suite capabilities
- Real platform support
- Existing configuration files and directories

## Files Modified

1. docs/index.md - Fixed typos, removed non-existent features
2. docs/getting-started/quick-start.md - Fixed multiple typos
3. docs/getting-started/development.md - Fixed typos, removed plugin references
4. docs/themes/thedetails.md - Fixed numerous typos, removed AI references
5. README.md - Fixed grammatical errors
6. mkdocs.yml - Updated navigation structure
7. docs/reference/commands.md - NEW: Complete command reference
8. docs/reference/features.md - NEW: Comprehensive features overview
9. docs/scripting/guide.md - NEW: Complete scripting guide

## Not Modified

- CONTRIBUTING.md - Already accurate, no typos found
- docs/README.md - Simple dev instructions, no issues
- Build and test infrastructure documentation

## Verification Needed

While updating documentation, inconsistencies were found in the source code:
- src/builtin/help_command.cpp still lists non-existent commands (ai, aihelp, plugin, prompt_test)
- These should be removed from the help output to match reality

The documentation now accurately reflects what actually exists in the codebase, not what the help command claims exists.
